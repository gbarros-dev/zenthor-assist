Check on the uncommitted changes and make multiple and organized commits.

Guidelines:

- Review all changes with `git status` and `git diff`
- Group related changes into logical commits
- Each commit should have a clear, focused purpose
- Write concise commit messages that explain the "why"
- Do NOT include any Claude attribution or "Generated with Claude Code" branding in commit messages
